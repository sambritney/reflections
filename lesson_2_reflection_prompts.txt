What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It let's git know that you are creating a new repository and want to use it for version control with the documents within.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging is the in between area for working and repository. It let’s you prep things - identify the files you want to commit, rather than assuming the whole directory is to be committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

By always committing after making a logical change…..

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Trying a new feature or testing something out. Perhaps even a language version, but testing only.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Good way to understand how things are branching out, as there could be multiple branches. Also helps to identify the stranded commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
The result is one branch, but with all the history of commits for the merged branches. 

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
There are definitely some things that can be missed via auto-merge. Someone’s new code could change something you don’t like. But at least part of it is auto, and then you can manually adjust anything that git can’t figure out.
