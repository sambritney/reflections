When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with others, or working on various machines/locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
You wouldnâ€™t want any of your work overridden, especially if there are multiple contributors. Seems like you would want to be conscious of this action, jut like committing and merging.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is when you take an exact copy of a repository. Forking is a clone that is done on GitHub. Branches are spun off from a set of documents within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you want to work offline, you can, and have the latest code possible.
