When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with others, or working on various machines/locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
You wouldnâ€™t want any of your work overridden, especially if there are multiple contributors. Seems like you would want to be conscious of this action, jut like committing and merging.
