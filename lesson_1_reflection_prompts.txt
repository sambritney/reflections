How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to use the two different files to compare and spot the difference.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If you run into issues you can always go back and see what changes caused you problems. Reduces time for troubleshooting for sure.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you decide what’s big/small as part of your decision-making process for committing, finding and describing commits is easier Cons: You might forget, wrong-size.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think it’s more around purpose. Git is specifically for software code, projects etc. whereas Google Docs is more for the consumer/casual user.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log can help me find the files I’m looking for, assuming I wrote good descriptions. Git diff can help me compare two files - maybe find where I made a mistake in code.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

you’ve got a back-up, so it’s like a fail safe switch. I’d be much more confident to make changes knowing this functionality is available.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version control for all my projects FTW!!!
